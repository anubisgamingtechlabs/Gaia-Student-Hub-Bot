## About
The Bot is named after a character in the video game [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn), it's written in Python and is filled with tons of features for you to spice your Discord experience up, it is also my submission to the [Sonoma Hackathon 2.0](https://sonoma-hacks-2-0.devpost.com/)!

## Implementation
The bot will be written in [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) a Python wrapper for the Discord API. It will also be using external APIs like [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/), [Open AI](https://textsynth.com/).

## Features

1. A chatbot! With the GPT-3 model mounted on a Discord Bot, this feature will keep you entertianed for a long time.
